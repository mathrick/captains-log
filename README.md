Captain's Log, the ethical pirate's tool
=============

What is it?
-----------
Have you ever downloaded a pirate copy of a game because there's no demo to check if it runs on your computer, only to forget to pay for it afterwards? That happens to me all the time, and keeping track of what I downloaded, what I want to pay for and what turned out to be worthless, and how best to pay for it (discounts, affiliate links, etc.) is a huge pain. This tool tries to automate it, so that no only can you make a list of items you consume and their payment status, but also helps with sharing payment info so that both you and the content creator can get the most out of it.
