Captain's Log, the ethical pirate's tool
=============

What is it?
-----------
Have you ever downloaded a pirate copy of a game because there's no demo to check if it runs on your computer, only to forget to pay for it afterwards? That happens to me all the time, and keeping track of what I downloaded, what I want to pay for and what turned out to be worthless, and how best to pay for it (discounts, affiliate links, etc.) is a huge pain. This tool tries to automate it, so that no only can you make a list of items you consume and their payment status, but also helps with sharing payment info so that both you and the content creator can get the most out of it.

Did you just say 'pirating'!?
-----------------------------
Yep. Pirating's a very good thing, and I say it as someone who makes a living off so-called "intellectual property" (which includes all the copyrighted things). First of all, our copyright law is completely out of whack, and it needs to be fixed. It doesn't serve the creators, it doesn't serve the consumers, it doesn't serve the public domain, and everyone and their dog sidestep it because it's just plain idiotic. The only people who actually benefit on the backwards situation are middlemen and so-called "artists organisations" (which don't really represent anyone except their lawyers, least of all artists).

Okay, so pirating's good. But doesn't it mean downloading without paying?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes and no. Pirating does mean getting some content without paying for it prior to acquisition, but it doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't support the creators who make things you enjoy. The detail everyone misses is that people **want to pay** for things they believe are a fair deal. That's the keyword, fair price for a fair deal. Why wouldn't they? After all, everyone likes to consider themselves fair and honest, and making sure the creators don't starve ultimately benefits yourself, as that's the best way to ensure there's more content coming from good creators. The problem with various "anti-piracy" groups is that they don't provide any useful service; to the contrary, they seek to enforce legally the outdated situation in which they're necessary for business, to the detriment of creators and consumers alike. That's no longer the case, and these days artists and other creators can communicate with their audiences directly, without any overhead from useless leeches like big labels and other kinds of mandatory middlemen.

So people want to pirate and want to pay. And?
----------------------------------------------
And this is a tool (in the form of a website) that seeks to make the "pay" part as painless as possible. By removing the pain of remembering what you downloaded and where you can pay for it, it tries to maximise the potential of piracy as a viable form of information-driven economy.
